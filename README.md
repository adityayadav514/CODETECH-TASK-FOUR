# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT Project : COMPUTER VISION TASK
Computer Vision Task Overview

You're right! Computer Vision is a fascinating field that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. Here's a comprehensive overview of the computer vision task:

Goals:

Image Understanding: Enable machines to interpret and understand visual information from images or videos.
Object Recognition: Identify and classify objects within images or videos.
Scene Understanding: Understand the context and meaning of visual scenes.
Tasks:

Image Classification: Classify images into predefined categories (e.g., objects, scenes, actions).
Object Detection: Detect and locate objects within images or videos.
Object Segmentation: Segment objects from the background and identify their boundaries.
Image Generation: Generate new images or modify existing ones using generative models.
Image Enhancement: Enhance image quality, remove noise, or restore degraded images.
Deliverables:

Trained Model: A trained computer vision model that can perform the specified task.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics and performance analysis of the trained model.
Visualizations: Visualizations of the model's outputs, such as bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or generated images.
Tools and Techniques:

Deep Learning Frameworks: Utilize popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras for building and training computer vision models.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Leverage CNNs for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks.
Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models and fine-tune them for specific tasks to reduce training time and improve performance.
Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase dataset size and diversity.
Real-World Applications:

Self-Driving Cars: Computer vision is used for object detection, tracking, and scene understanding in autonomous vehicles.
Medical Imaging: Computer vision is applied to medical images for diagnosis, tumor detection, and patient monitoring.
Surveillance: Computer vision is used for object detection, tracking, and activity recognition in surveillance systems.
